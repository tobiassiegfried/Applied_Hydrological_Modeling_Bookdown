@article{Aizen_2007,
	abstract = {In this study, we estimated the current glacier state and forecast the potential impact of global
and regional climate change on the glaciers and glacier runoff in the Tien Shan. General (G)
and detailed (D) simulations were developed based on assessment of the Tien Shan glacier
recession between 1943 and 2003 using an iterative stepwise increase in the equilibrium line
altitude of 20 m. The G simulation was developed for 2777 grids each of which covered over
1000 km2 
of glacier surface and D for the 15 953 Tien Shan glaciers. Both simulations employed
glacier morphometric characteristics derived from Digital Elevation Model based on
remote sensing data, high resolution maps and in situ GPS validation. Simulated
changes in glacier area demonstrated that a possible increase in air temperature of
1 $\,^{\circ}$C 
at  must be compensated by a 100 mm increase in precipitation at the same altitude if Tien Shan
glaciers are to be maintained in their current state. An increase in mean air temperature of
4 $\,^{\circ}$C 
and precipitation of 1.1 times the current level could increase  by 570 m during the 21st century. Under these conditions, the number of glaciers,
glacier covered area, glacier volume, and glacier runoff are predicted to be 94%,
69%, 75%, and 75% of current values. The maximum glacier runoff may reach
as much as 1.25 times current levels while the minimum will likely equal zero.},

@article{gerlitz_2018,
	abstract = {{In order to understand the atmospheric mechanisms resulting in a pronounced cold season climate variability in Central Asia, an objective weather type classification is conducted, utilizing a k-means based clustering-approach applied to 500hPa geopotential height (GPH) fields. Eight weather types (WT) are identified and analyzed with regard to characteristic pressure patterns and moisture fluxes over Eurasia and specific near surface climate conditions over Central Asia. In order to identify remote drivers of the Central Asian climate, WT frequencies are analyzed for their relationships with tropical and extratropical teleconnection modes. The results indicate an influence of northern hemispheric planetary wave tracks on westerly moisture fluxes with positive anomalies of precipitation associated with the formation of a Rossby trough over Central Asia. Particularly the propagation of the East-Atlantic/Western-Russia and the Scandinavian patterns are shown to modulate regional climate conditions. Variations of ENSO are shown to affect the frequency of particular WTs due to the formation of an anticyclonic anomaly over the Indian Ocean and an increase of tropical fluxes of moisture and heat into Central Asia during El Nino events. Further a WT-internal influence of ENSO is distinctly defined, with enhanced moisture supply during the ENSO warm phase. The analysis of climatic trends shows that 50\% of observed temperature changes can be assigned to variations of the WT composition, indicating that most likely changing regional circulation characteristics account for the enhanced warming rates in Central Asia. Trends of precipitation sums are likewise shown to be associated with changing WT frequencies, although the WT-precipitation relationships include large uncertainties.}},

@article{siegfried_2012,
	abstract = {{Millions of people in the geopolitically important region of Central Asia depend on water from snow- and glacier-melt driven international rivers, most of all the Syr Darya and Amu Darya. The riparian countries of these rivers have experienced recurring water allocation conflicts ever since the Soviet Union collapsed. Will climate change exacerbate water stress and thus conflicts? We have developed a coupled climate, land-ice and rainfall-runoff model for the Syr Darya to quantify impacts and show that climatic changes are likely to have consequences on runoff seasonality due to earlier snow-melt. This will increase water stress in unregulated catchments because less water will be available for irrigation in the summer months. Threats from geohazards, above all glacier lake outbursts, are likely to increase as well. The area at highest risk is the densely populated, agriculturally productive, and politically unstable Fergana Valley. Targeted infrastructural developments will be required in the region. If the current mismanagement of water and energy resources can be replaced with more effective resource allocation mechanisms through the strengthening of transboundary institutions, Central Asia will be able to successfully address these future climate-related challenges.}},
