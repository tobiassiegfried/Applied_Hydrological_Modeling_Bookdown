@article{seibert_teaching_2012,
	abstract = {Computer models, especially conceptual models, are frequently used for catchment hydrology studies. Teaching hydrological modeling, however, is challenging, since students have to both understand general model concepts and be able to use particular computer programs when learning to apply computer models. Here we present a new version of the HBV (Hydrologiska Byra˚ns Vattenavdelning) model. This software provides a user-friendly version that is especially useful for education. Different functionalities, such as an automatic calibration using a genetic algorithm or a Monte Carlo approach, as well as the possibility to perform batch runs with predefined model parameters make the software interesting especially for teaching in more advanced classes and research projects. Different teaching goals related to hydrological modeling are discussed and a series of exercises is suggested to reach these goals.},

	abstract = {A comprehensive re-evaluation of the HBV hydrological model has been carried out. The objectives were to improve its potential for making use of spatially distributed data, to make it more physically sound and to improve the model performance. The new version, HBV-96, uses subbasin division with a typical resolution of 40 km 2, although any resolution can be used. In addition, each subbasin is divided into elevation bands, vegetation and snow classes. Automatic weighting of precipitation and temperature stations was introduced and a new automatic calibration scheme was developed. The modifications led to significant improvements in model performance. In seven test basins the average value of the efficiency criterion R z increased from 86 to 89\%, with improvements in both the calibration and verification periods. {\copyright} 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.},

It covers a discussion on the optimal complexity of models, use of observations, calibration, control and sensitivity analysis.

@article{bloschl_scale_1995,
	abstract = {A framework is provided for scaling and scale issues in hydrology. The first section gives some basic definitions. This is important as researchers do not seem to have agreed on the meaning of concepts such as scale or upscaling. `Process scale', `observation scale' and `modelling (working) scale' require different definitions. The second section discusses heterogeneity and variability in catchments and touches on the implications of randomness and organization for scaling. The third section addresses the linkages across scales from a modelling point of view. It is argued that upscaling typically consists of two steps: distributing and aggregating. Conversely, downscaling involves disaggregation and singling out. Different approaches are discussed for linking state variables, parameters, inputs and conceptualizations across scales. This section also deals with distributed parameter models, which are one way of linking conceptualizations across scales. The fourth section addresses the linkages across scales from a more holistic perspective dealing with dimensional analysis and similarity concepts. The main difference to the modelling point of view is that dimensional analysis and similarity concepts deal with complex processes in a much simpler fashion. Examples of dimensional analysis, similarity analysis and functional normalization in catchment hydrology are given. This section also briefly discusses fractals, which are a popular tool for quantifying variability across scales. The fifth section focuses on one particular aspect of this holistic view, discussing stream network analysis. The paper concludes with identifying key issues and gives some directions for future research.},

@article{refsgaard_uncertainty_2007,
	abstract = {A terminology and typology of uncertainty is presented together with a framework for the modelling process, its interaction with the broader water management process and the role of uncertainty at different stages in the modelling processes. Brief reviews have been made of 14 different (partly complementary) methods commonly used in uncertainty assessment and characterisation: data uncertainty engine (DUE), error propagation equations, expert elicitation, extended peer review, inverse modelling (parameter estimation), inverse modelling (predictive uncertainty), Monte Carlo analysis, multiple model simulation, NUSAP, quality assurance, scenario analysis, sensitivity analysis, stakeholder involvement and uncertainty matrix. The applicability of these methods has been mapped according to purpose of application, stage of the modelling process and source and type of uncertainty addressed. It is concluded that uncertainty assessment is not just something to be added after the completion of the modelling work. Instead uncertainty should be seen as a red thread throughout the modelling study starting from the very beginning, where the identification and characterisation of all uncertainty sources should be performed jointly by the modeller, the water manager and the stakeholders. {\'O} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{ARORA2002164,
	abstract = {Available energy (often expressed in terms of potential evaporation) and precipitation largely determine annual evapotranspiration and runoff rates in a region. The ratio of annual potential evaporation to precipitation, referred to as the aridity index by Budyko, has been shown to describe the evaporation ratio (the ratio of annual evapotranspiration to precipitation) of catchments from a range of climatic regimes in a number of studies. It has been shown that aridity index alone can be used to obtain an estimate of ratio of standard deviation of annual evapotranspiration estimates to that of precipitation (the evaporation deviation ratio). At present, there are at least five functional forms available, which describe evaporation ratio as a function of aridity index. This study assesses data from Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling and Analysis' (CCCma) third-generation atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM) against these five functional forms. Evaporation ratio and evaporation deviation ratios from an AGCM simulation are compared against these five functional forms and it is shown that the primary control of available energy and precipitation over annual partitioning of precipitation, and interannual variability of evapotranspiration, is preserved well in the AGCM. The aridity index is further used to obtain an analytic equation, which can be used to estimate change in runoff given annual changes in precipitation and available energy. This equation is validated using data from control and climate change simulations of the CCCma coupled GCM (CGCM1) and shown to perform fairly well. The correlation between CGCM1 simulated annual change in runoff and the values obtained using aridity index is consistently around 0.95, and the average bias varies between 40.5 and 50.3mm/year, for the five functional forms. The successful validation of this equation against data from a GCM climate change simulation illustrates the continued relevance of aridity index, and the primary control of precipitation and available energy in determining annual evapotranspiration and runoff rates.},

@article{https://doi.org/10.1002/rra.774,
	abstract = {Abstract High spatio-temporal resolution monitoring has only been progressively developed in the Rhine--Meuse basins over the last few decades. As a consequence, basic hydrological information can be very scarce in some areas. In regions which are homogeneous from a hydroclimatological and physiogeographical point of view, hydrographs can be reproduced via regionalized hydrological models, provided that climatological observation series are available. The Alzette river basin, monitored since the mid-1990s by a very dense hydroclimatological observation network, had been chosen in the framework of the IRMA-SPONGE project FRHYMAP for transposing the conceptual hydrological models HRM and SOCONT and regionalizing their parameters. The regionalized models were to be used both for extending the currently available runoff series and evaluating runoff in neighbouring non-monitored basins. The 16 monitored sub-basins of the Alzette, reflecting the physiogeographical diversity of the study area, were divided into two subsets, serving for both the calibration and the validation procedures. Once the transposition of the models to the Alzette basin had been successfully assessed, their parameters were linked to the physiogeographical characteristics of the sub-basins. The performance of the thus regionalized models was assessed via a validation on a subset of basins that had not been retained for the elaboration of the regional parameter sets. The transposition of the HRM and SOCONT model to the Alzette river basin was completed successfully. Results overall proved to be satisfying, with the HRM model performing equally well for low flows and high flows, while the SOCONT model showed best results for high flows and a systematic overestimation of the mean discharge. Both models proved to be adequate for evaluating daily runoff in non-monitored basins of the Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg, helping thus to counterbalance the considerable lack of hydrological observation series in this part of the Rhine basin.

This study conducted a Budyko-based framework for quantifying the impacts of aridity index and other factors on annual runoff in 355 catchments in the United States. The aridity index is the ratio of potential evapotranspiration to precipitation, representing the dry conditions in Budyko framework. Other factors are the influence of everything else except the aridity index, and are represented by the parameter w in Budyko-type equations, which is a time-dependent variable in this case. Then, the impacts of aridity index and other factors were decomposed based on the annual variations in the Budyko spaces. The results show the current Budyko-type equations, which use time-varying parameters, can improve the fitting capability for most catchments in the United States. Aridity index is the main driver causing the increasing trend of runoff in the US. Other factors, on the other hand, are the main reasons for the decreasing trend of runoff in the US.}},

	abstract = {{Effect of climate change and catchment change on the long‐term water balance is of considerable interest at a range of spatial scales. The total differential of runoff within the Budyko framework, which has been widely used to attribute the change in runoff to the effect of climate and catchment changes, is not precise in which there is always some residual between the observed and estimated change in runoff. The objective of this study is to propose and evaluate a new partition method based on the Budyko complementary relationship for runoff. Algebraic identities have ensured that the change in runoff can be decomposed into two components precisely without any residuals using this complementary method. In addition, the complementary method allows estimation of the upper and lower bounds of the climate effect and catchment effect. The new method was compared with the total differential method and an extrapolation method for 15 catchments in Australia. Results show that the average range of the catchment effect using the complementary method was 6.7 mm for 14 of the 15 catchments, which is much smaller than that estimated with the total differential method (51.5 mm). The average of the upper and lower bounds was shown to be in good agreement with the effect of climate and catchment changes estimated using the extrapolation method (R2 = 0.98 for both). Correlation analysis indicates that the average of these bounds is the best estimate of the magnitude of the climate and catchment effect for the 15 catchments examined. Climate and catchment effect on the change in the mean annual runoff can be partitioned precisely using a complementary method The complementary method is better than the total differential method in estimating the catchment effect Average of the upper and lower bounds of the catchment effect is in good agreement with the results using the extrapolation method}},

	abstract = {{Increased surface temperatures are expected to cause less precipitation in the form of snow. The impact of decreased snowfall has previously been assumed to not influence streamflow significantly. This work applies a water-balance framework to catchments in the United States and finds a greater percentage of precipitation as snowfall is associated with greater mean streamflow. In a warming climate, precipitation is less likely to occur as snowfall1,2. A shift from a snow- towards a rain-dominated regime is currently assumed not to influence the mean streamflow significantly1,3,4,5. Contradicting the current paradigm, we argue that mean streamflow is likely to reduce for catchments that experience significant reductions in the fraction of precipitation falling as snow. With more than one-sixth of the Earth's population depending on meltwater for their water supply3 and ecosystems that can be sensitive to streamflow alterations6, the socio-economic consequences of a reduction in streamflow can be substantial. By applying the Budyko water balance framework7 to catchments located throughout the contiguous United States we demonstrate that a higher fraction of precipitation falling as snow is associated with higher mean streamflow, compared to catchments with marginal or no snowfall. Furthermore, we show that the fraction of each year's precipitation falling as snowfall has a significant influence on the annual streamflow within individual catchments. This study is limited to introducing these observations; process-based understanding at the catchment scale is not yet provided. Given the importance of streamflow for society, further studies are required to respond to the consequences of a temperature-induced precipitation shift from snow to rain.}},

	abstract = {{Mean annual evapotranspiration from a catchment is determined largely by precipitation and potential evapotranspiration; characteristics of the catchment (e.g., soil, topography, etc.) play only a secondary role. It has been shown that the ratio of mean annual potential evapotranspiration to precipitation (referred as the index of dryness) can be used to estimate mean annual evapotranspiration by using one additional parameter. This study evaluates the effects of climatic and catchment characteristics on the partitioning of mean annual precipitation into evapotranspiration using a rational function approach, which was developed based on phenomenological considerations. Over 470 catchments worldwide with long-term records of precipitation, potential evapotranspiration, and runoff were considered, and results show that model estimates of mean annual evapotranspiration agree well with observed evapotranspiration taken as the difference between precipitation and runoff. The mean absolute error between modeled and observed evapotranspiration was 54 mm, and the model was able to explain 89\% of the variance with a slope of 1.00 through the origin. This indicates that the index of dryness is the most significant variable in determining mean annual evapotranspiration. Results also suggest that forested catchments tend to show higher evapotranspiration than grassed catchments and their evapotranspiration ratio (evapotranspiration divided by precipitation) is most sensitive to changes in catchment characteristics for regions with the index of dryness around 1.0. Additionally, a stepwise regression analysis was performed for over 270 Australian catchments where detailed information of vegetation cover, precipitation characteristics, catchment slopes, and plant available water capacity was available. It is shown that apart from the index of dryness, average storm depth, plant available water capacity, and storm arrival rate are also significant.}},

	abstract = {{An increase in climate change has been leading to non-stationarity in hydrological variables. Therefore, a simple framework within the Budyko hypothesis is proposed to estimate the annual runoff frequency distribution and provide a new method for practical application in hydrological design under the non-stationarity. In this framework, the annual runoff statistic parameters, mean value (MAR) and standard deviation (STD), are derived by the Choudhury-Yang equation; at the same time, a magnification factor γ 1  = 1.358 is introduced to correct the underestimation of the Budyko-based estimated STD according to observation data in 291 catchments across China. Furthermore, the P-Ш type frequency curve is selected to calculate the annual runoff on a specific design return period. Here, the impacts of non-stationarity caused by climate change was considered to be encoded in the changes in statistic parameters and frequency distribution. Based on this framework, the changes in water resources in 207 three-level basins across China during 2020--2050 are given. The results show that the average MAR will decrease by 2.7\% for all basins, and the spatial distribution of MAR will be more even, i.e., it will increase in the north of China and decrease in the south of China. However, the inter-annual variability of annual runoff (shown as STD and variance coefficient, Cv ) will increase in more than 70\% of basins. Additionally, in the dry year, about 65\% of basins show decreased runoff change, which indicates a larger reservoir capacity is need for water resource allocation. These findings offer a simple and effective way to re-examine the effects of non-stationarity on projected annual runoff.}},

	abstract = {{ At present, many conceptual water balance models have been proposed on monthly, annual, and mean annual timescales. With the increasing applications of these models, an emerging question is whether the water balance models on different timescales have some commonalities and can be integrated. To this end, this study established and applied a practical unified framework of water balance models that can be applied to different timescales. The framework was first developed on monthly timescale, where the water balance was captured by combining the ``abcd'' model and Budyko hypothesis with four parameters. Then, this framework was extended to annual and mean annual timescales under which certain parameters can be eliminated or assumed to be certain values. To be specific, on the annual timescale, the water balance was simulated by a Budyko-type model incorporating the water storage change; on the mean annual timescale the water balance was further simplified into a Budyko-type model which neglects the water storage change. Thus, all of the three typical water balance models on different timescales were unified to a general framework. The models were applied to 437 catchments in the contiguous United States with satisfying results achieved. Considering the water storage changes can improve the performance of annual water balance models in regions with clear interannual carrying water storage. Furthermore, the water balance models on different timescales share common supply and demand limits which is similar to Budyko hypothesis.}},

	abstract = {{Substantial climate change and intensive anthropogenic activities hamper efforts to explain and predict the variability of the terrestrial water balance. The Budyko framework has recently seen a renaissance in hydrological research due to the framework's comprehensiveness and effectiveness for studying the effects of global change on water resources. In this paper, the development of the Budyko framework is analysed first. The temporal and spatial variability for the Budyko hypothesis are subsequently elaborated. On finer temporal scales, more processes need to be considered, and the degree of control exerted by individual factors on the water balance varies with the spatial scale considered. Finally, perspectives regarding better understanding and application of the Budyko framework at the catchment scale are provided. A representative and diverse catchment data set is required to estimate the parameter in the model. The co-evolution of landscape characteristics and climate properties would be beneficial to improve the Budyko framework with respect to model parsimony and the physical background. It is necessary to illuminate how the empirical Budyko curve would change under climate change. The general laws for selecting variables and statistical methods for improving Budyko models still need to be explored.}},

	abstract = {{Direct runoff and baseflow are the two primary components of total streamflow, and their accurate estimation is indispensable for a variety of hydrologic applications. While direct runoff is the quick response stemming from surface and shallow subsurface flow paths and is often associated with floods, baseflow represents the groundwater contribution from stored sources (e.g., groundwater) to streams and is crucial for environmental flow regulations, and water supply, among others. L'vovich (1979, https://doi.org/10.1029/SP013) proposed a two‐step water balance partitioning, where precipitation is divided into direct runoff and catchment wetting, followed by the disaggregation of the latter into baseflow and evapotranspiration. Here, we investigate the role of the aridity index (ratio between mean‐annual potential evapotranspiration and precipitation) in controlling the long‐term (mean‐annual) fluxes of direct runoff and baseflow. We present an analytical solution beginning with similar assumptions as proposed by Budyko (1974, https://www.elsevier.com/books/climate-and-life/budyko/978-0-12-139450-9), leading to two complementary expressions for the two fluxes. The aridity index explained 77\% and 89\% of variability in direct runoff and baseflow from 378 catchments within the continental United States, while our formulations were able to reproduce the patterns of water balance partitioning proposed by L'vovich (1979, https://doi.org/10.1029/SP013) at the mean‐annual timescale. Our approach can be used to further understand how climate and landscape controls the terrestrial water balance at mean‐annual timescales, while also representing a step toward the prediction of baseflow and direct runoff at ungauged basins. Mean‐annual baseflow and direct runoff, estimated using a low‐pass filter, are controlled to first order by the aridity index The dependence of both fluxes on the aridity index is parameterized considering their limits when aridity index approaches 0 The proposed formulations can reproduce water balance partitioning of the L'vovich (1979, https://doi.org/10.1029/SP013) framework at the mean‐annual timescale}},

	abstract = {{Many previous studies have evaluated the hydrologic response to climate change using the first-order approximation (first-order Taylor expansion) of the Mezentsev-Choudhury-Yang equation (formulating the Budyko hypothesis), which has a parameter n representing catchment characteristics. However, no studies have paid attention to the error due to the first-order approximation. This study therefore estimates this error to improve the theoretical framework for assessing the contribution of climate change to runoff based on the Budyko hypothesis. Specifically, the error increases when precipitation (P) decreases and potential evaporation (E0) increases, and n increases. Therefore, an increasing P or decreasing E0 leads to an underestimate of the climatic contributions, while a decreasing P or increasing E0 leads to an overestimate. In addition, we suggest a new method to accurately estimate the contribution of climate change to runoff.}},

	abstract = {{We introduce a set of global high-resolution (0.05◦) precipitation (P) climatologies corrected for bias using streamflow (Q) observations from 9372 stations worldwide. For each station, we inferred the ``true'' long-term P using a Budyko curve, an empirical equation relating long-term P, Q, and potential evaporation. We subsequently calculated long-term bias correction factors for three state-of-the-art P climatologies (WorldClim V2, CHELSA V1.2, and CHPclim V1), after which we used random forest regression to produce global gap-free bias correction maps for the climatologies. Monthly climatological bias correction factors were calculated by disaggregating the long-term bias correction factors based on gauge catch efficiencies. We found that all three climatologies systematically underestimate P over parts of all major mountain ranges globally, despite the explicit consideration of orography in the production of each climatology. Additionally, all climatologies underestimate P at latitudes > 60◦N, likely due to gauge under-catch. Exceptionally high long-term correction factors (> 1.5) were obtained for all three climatologies in Alaska, High Mountain Asia, and Chile --- regions characterized by marked elevation gradients, sparse gauge networks, and significant snowfall. Using the bias-corrected WorldClim V2, we demonstrated that other widely used P datasets (GPCC V2015, GPCP V2.3, and MERRA-2) severely underestimate P over Chile, the Himalayas, and along the Pacific coast of North America. Mean P for the global land surface based on the bias-corrected WorldClim V2 is 862 mm yr−1 (a 9.4 \% increase over the original WorldClim V2). The annual and monthly bias-corrected P climatologies have been released as the Precipitation Bias CORrection (PBCOR) dataset --- downloadable via www.gloh2o.org/pbcor.}},

Based on this framework, the water storage change in the watershed is assumed to be negligible at large spatial and temporal scales. However, steady state conditions are not valid for many watersheds worldwide or at finer temporal or spatial scales. Accordingly, the application of the Budyko framework has become challenging for these situations. Therefore, many researchers have tried to extend the Budyko framework for non-steady state conditions. The aim of this study is to provide a review of the extended equations and to discuss about using the Budyko framework in a changing world. While the extended equations are more complex than the original ones, they require less data. Thus, the Budyko framework, either the original or the extended can be a very useful tool for hydrological modeling with lots of applications, especially in data scarce regions.}},

Several Budyko-based methods have been widely used to attribute hydrological variations and identify the extent of variation due to climate change and human activities. However, the accuracy of various methods has rarely been compared. This study employed four Budyko-based methods, namely the total differential method, complementary method, extrapolation method, and decomposition method, to attribute the changes in actual evapotranspiration in 13 basins in China's Loess Plateau. We compared their performances and analysed factors that contribute to the differences in attribution results yielded by the various methods. The results showed that the total differential, complementary, and decomposition methods presented similar estimates of the contributions of climate change and human activities. However, the extrapolation method showed a large deviation in the contribution of human activities. The error of the extrapolation method was the largest, followed by that of the two-stage total differential method. The complementary method and decomposition method exhibited negligible errors.}},

	abstract = {{A warmer climate may lead to less precipitation falling as snow in cold seasons. Such a switch in the state of precipitation not only alters temporal distribution of intra-annual runoff but also tends to yield less total annual runoff. Long-term water balance for 282 catchments across China is investigated, showing that a decreasing snow ratio reduces annual runoff for a given total precipitation. Within the Budyko framework, we develop an equation to quantify the relationship between snow ratio and annual runoff from a water--energy balance viewpoint. Based on the proposed equation, attribution of runoff change during the past several decades and possible runoff change induced by projected snow ratio change using climate experiment outputs archived in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) are analyzed. Results indicate that annual runoff in northwestern mountainous and northern high-latitude areas are sensitive to snow ratio change. The proposed model is applicable to other catchments easily and quantitatively for analyzing the effects of possible change in snow ratio on available water resources and evaluating the vulnerability of catchments to climate change.}},

	abstract = {{Abstract. Bouchet's complementary relationship and the Budyko hypothesis are two classic frameworks that are inter-connected. To systematically investigate the connections between the two frameworks, we analyze precipitation, pan evaporation, and potential evaporation data at 259 weather stations across the United States. The precipitation and pan evaporation data are from field measurement and the potential evaporation data are collected from a remote-sensing dataset. We use pan evaporation to represent ``apparent'' potential evaporation, which is different from potential evaporation. With these data, we study the correlations between precipitation and potential evaporation, and between precipitation and ``apparent'' potential evaporation. The results show that 93 \% of the study's weather stations exhibit a negative correlation between precipitation and ``apparent'' potential evaporation. Also, the aggregated data cloud of precipitation vs. ``apparent'' potential evaporation with 5312 warm-season data points from 259 weather stations shows a negative trend in which ``apparent'' potential evaporation decreases with increasing precipitation. On the other hand, no significant correlation is found in the data cloud of precipitation vs. potential evaporation, indicating that precipitation and potential evaporation are independent. We combine a Budyko-type expression, the Turc--Pike equation, with Bouchet's complementary relationship to derive upper and lower Bouchet--Budyko curves, which display a complementary relationship between ``apparent'' potential evaporation and actual evaporation. The observed warm-season data follow the trend of the Bouchet--Budyko curves. Our study shows the consistency between Budyko's framework and Bouchet's complementary relationship, with the distinction between potential evaporation and ``apparent'' potential evaporation. The formulated complementary relationship can be used in quantitative modeling practices.}},

	abstract = {{Accurately estimating large-scale evapotranspiration (ET) rates is essential to understanding and predicting global change. Evapotranspiration models that are applied at a continental scale typically operate on relatively large spatial grids, with the result that the heterogeneity in land surface properties and processes at smaller spatial scales cannot be explicitly represented. Averaging over this spatial heterogeneity may lead to biased estimates of energy and water fluxes. Here we estimate how averaging over spatial heterogeneity in precipitation (P) and potential evapotranspiration (PET) may affect grid-cell-averaged evapotranspiration rates, as seen from the atmosphere over heterogeneous landscapes across the globe. Our goal is to identify where, under what conditions, and at what scales this ``heterogeneity bias'' could be most important but not to quantify its absolute magnitude. We use Budyko curves as simple functions that relate ET to precipitation and potential evapotranspiration. Because the relationships driving ET are nonlinear, averaging over subgrid heterogeneity in P and PET will lead to biased estimates of average ET. We examine the global distribution of this bias, its scale dependence, and its sensitivity to variations in P vs. PET. Our analysis shows that this heterogeneity bias is more pronounced in mountainous terrain, in landscapes where spatial variations in P and PET are inversely correlated, and in regions with temperate climates and dry summers. We also show that this heterogeneity bias increases on average, and expands over larger areas, as the grid cell size increases.}},

In this study, the single parameter Budyko equation was used. The Budyko equation represents the water-energy balance, and the parameter n represents all the characteristics in the system that affect the partition of precipitation (P) into runoff (R) and evapotranspiration (E). The dynamics of the n in watersheds were studied. The Granger causality was adopted to explore the interactions between n and various influencing factors including hydro-meteorological factors and underlying surface characteristics. Two basins located in the Loess Plateau were selected as a case study. The results indicated that (1) the n of the Jing River Basin (JRB) has a continuous increasing trend and that of the Beiluo River Basin has a continuous decreasing trend; (2) there are strong interplays between n and R, the aridity index (Ep/P), and evaporative ratio (E/P) in both watersheds; (3) soil moisture interacts with R and E/P, thereby unidirectionally influencing the n in both watersheds; and (4) the effective irrigation area interacts with n through its strong impacts on E/P and EP/P in the JRB.}},

	abstract = {{Water availability is of importance for a wide range of ecological, climatological, and socioeconomic applications. Over land, the partitioning of precipitation into evapotranspiration and runoff essentially determines the availability of water. At mean annual catchment scales, the widely used Budyko framework provides a simple, deterministic, first-order relationship to estimate this partitioning as a function of the prevailing climatic conditions. Here we extend the framework by introducing a method to specify probabilistic estimates of water availability that account for the nonlinearity of the underlying phase space. The new framework allows to evaluate the predictability of water availability that is related to varying catchment characteristics and conditional on the underlying climatic conditions. Corresponding results support the practical experience of low predictability of river runoff in transitional climates.}},

	abstract = {{ Budyko's treatment of the long-term water balance of watersheds was based on the competition between water availability and energy supply. It assumes, in the long-term, that precipitation is the only source of water availability for evapotranspiration while the changes in soil water storage are negligible. For arid irrigation areas with shallow water tables, however, groundwater also can supply crop water demand in addition to irrigation and precipitation. In this study, we present a new Budyko formula considering seasonal groundwater uptake and soil water storage changes estimated by Aver'yanov's equation and abcd model, respectively. The use of groundwater depths rather than the variation of groundwater levels makes it more reasonable to estimate seasonal groundwater consumption. For the application of the Budyko equation in unsteady state areas, equivalent precipitation was designed to take the place of precipitation as water availability. With the newly defined water availability, the relationship between evapotranspiration ratio and aridity index was described successfully by Budyko curves, otherwise the points exceeded Budyko domain with only precipitation and irrigation considered. Furthermore, for agricultural irrigation areas, the variation of seasonal ω is supposed to be affected by vegetation coverage (denoted by NDVI). Overall, it is possible to estimate regional actual seasonal and annual evapotranspiration for irrigation areas with shallow groundwater using the extended Budyko models. This new method can play significant role in water management in arid and semiarid agricultural regions.}},

Based on end- member mixing analysis (EMMA), the hydrograph separation was carried out in six benchmark catchments with different glacier area ratios (GARs) and snow area ratios (SARs) during a typical snow melt period (TSMP) and a typical glacier melt period (TGMP). The results indicate that the contribution of snow/glacier meltwater to river runoff is positively correlated with GARs or maximum SARs. The contribution ratios of snowmelt water vary from 22\% to 49\% in TSMP. The contribution ratios of glacier meltwater vary from 12\% to 59\% in TGMP. The contribution ratios of snow meltwater in the northern Tianshan Mountains (36\%) are higher than central Tianshan Mountains (31\%), while the contribution ratios of glacier meltwater in the northern Tianshan Mountains (36\%) are lower than central Tianshan Mountains (42\%). The contribution of rainfall to river runoff is higher in TGMP (9\%--23\%) than in TSMP (5\%--9\%). Baseflow is the most important recharge source to river runoff, with the contribution ratios vary from 44\% to 73\% in TSMP, and vary from 30\% to 75\% in TGMP. The spatial and temporal variations in tracer concentrations in streamflow components were found to be responsible to the uncertainties in hydrograph separation.}},

	abstract = {{It is now well established that forested catchments have higher evapotranspiration than grassed catchments. Thus land use management and rehabilitation strategies will have an impact on catchment water balance and hence water yield and groundwater recharge. The key controls on evapotranspiration are rainfall interception, net radiation, advection, turbulent transport, leaf area, and plant‐available water capacity. The relative importance of these factors depends on climate, soil, and vegetation conditions. Results from over 250 catchments worldwide show that for a given forest cover, there is a good relationship between long‐term average evapotranspiration and rainfall. From these observations and on the basis of previous theoretical work a simple two‐parameter model was developed that relates mean annual evapotranspiration to rainfall, potential evapotranspiration, and plant‐available water capacity. The mean absolute error between modeled and measured evapotranspiration was 42 mm or 6.0\%; the least squares line through the origin had as lope of 1.00 and a correlation coefficient of 0.96. The model showed potential for a variety of applications including water yield modeling and recharge estimation. The model is a practical tool that can be readily used for assessing the long‐term average effect of vegetation changes on catchment evapotranspiration and is scientifically justifiable.}},

	abstract = {{Water availability is of major importance for a wide range of socio-economic sectors. Over land, the partitioning of precipitation (P) into evapotranspiration (E) and runoff (Q) is the key process to assess hydrological conditions. For climatological averages, the Budyko framework provides a simple first order relationship to estimate the evaporative index E / P as a function of the aridity index (Ep / P, with Ep denoting potential evaporation). However, a major downside of the Budyko framework is its limitation to steady state conditions, being a result of the assumption of a closed land water balance. Nonstationary processes coming into play at other than mean annual catchment scales are thus not represented. Here we propose an analytically derived new formulation of the Budyko curve including an additional parameter being implicitly related to the nonlinear storage term of the land water balance. The new framework is comprehensively analysed, showing that the additional parameter leads to an upward rotation of the original supply limit and therefore implicitly represents the amount of additional water available for evaporation. The obtained model is further validated using standard datasets of P, E and Ep. It is shown that the model is capable to represent first-order seasonal dynamics within the hydroclimatological system.}},

	abstract = {{The Budyko functions relate the evaporation ratio E / P (E is evaporation and P precipitation) to the aridity index Φ = Ep / P (Ep is potential evaporation) and are valid on long timescales under steady state conditions. A new formulation physically based (noted ML) is proposed to extend the Budyko framework under non-steady state conditions taking into account the change in soil water storage S. The ML formulation introduces an additional parameter S* = S / Ep and can be applied with all classical Budyko functions. In the standard Budyko space (Ep / P, E / P), and for the particular case where the Fu-Zhang equation is used as a Budyko function, the ML formulation yields similar results to the analytical solution of Greve et al. (2016), and a simple relationship can be established between their respective parameters. Then, the ML formulation is extended to the space [(Ep / (P + S), E / (P + S)] and compared to the formulations of Chen et al. (2013) and Du et al. (2016). We show that the ML and Greve et al. formulations have similar upper feasible domain but their lower feasible domain is different from those of Chen et al. (2103) and Du et al. (2016). Moreover, the domain of variation of Ep / (P + S) differs: it is bounded by an upper limit 1 / S* in the ML formulation, while it is bounded with a lower limit in Chen et al.'s and Du et al.'s formulations.}},

Accelerating anthropogenic land-use and climate change have sparked a renewed interest in predictive applications of the Budyko equation to analyze future scenarios important to water resource management. These applications, in turn, have inspired a number of attempts to derive mathematical models of the Budyko equation from a variety of specific assumptions about the original Budyko hypothesis. Here, we show that the Budyko equation and all extant models of it can be derived rigorously from a single mathematical assumption concerning the Budyko hypothesis.

A mathematical extension of the Budyko formula with explicit account for the soil moisture storage change is used to show that, in catchments with a strong seasonal coupling between precipitation and potential evaporation, climate aridity has a dominant control on intra‐annual streamflow variability. But in other catchments, additional factors related to soil water storage change also have important controls on how precipitation seasonality propagates to streamflow. More importantly, use of leaf area index as a direct and indirect indicator of the above ground biomass and plant root system, respectively, reveals the vital role of vegetation in regulating soil moisture storage and hence streamflow intra‐annual variability under different climate conditions. Ratio between seasonal variability of precipitation and streamflow decomposed under Budyko framework Control of climate aridity, seasonality in precip, and its coupling with ET on catchment responses Vegetation plays an important role when the climate seasonality is weak}},

	abstract = {{Partitioning of precipitation into evapotranspiration and runoff is controlled by climate and catchment characteristics. The degree of control exerted by these factors varies with the spatial and temporal scales of processes modeled. The Budyko framework or the ``limits'' concept was used to model water balance at four temporal scales (mean annual, annual, monthly and daily). The method represents a top-down approach to hydrologic modeling and is expected to achieve parsimony of model parameters. Daily precipitation, potential evapotranspiration, and streamflow from 265 catchments in Australia were used. On a mean annual basis, the index of dryness defined as the ratio of potential evapotranspiration to precipitation was confirmed to be a dominant factor in determining the water balance with one model parameter. Analysis of the data, however, suggested increased model complexity is necessary on finer time scale such as monthly. In response, the Budyko framework for mean annual water balance was extended to include additional factors and this resulted in a parsimonious lumped conceptual model on shorter-time scale. The model was calibrated and tested against measured streamflow at variable time scales and showed promising results. The strengths of the model are consistent water balance relationships across different time scales, and model parsimony and robustness. As result, the model has the potential to be used to predict streamflow for ungauged catchments.}},

	abstract = {{ The Budyko parameter, which controls the shape of Budyko curve, represents the superimposed impact of various periodic factors (including climatic factors, catchment characteristics, large-scale climate patterns, solar activity and anthropogenic activity) on the watershed water-energy balance dynamics. However, this superimposition is not conducive to identifying the drivers of Budyko parameter dynamics at different time scales, and thus affects parameter estimation. Here we obtain the Budyko parameter ω in the Fu's equation (one form of the Budyko framework) for the Wei River Basin (WRB), and then adopt the Empirical Mode Decomposition method to reveal the relationships between factors and ω series at multiple time scales by considering the interplay among different influencing factors. Results indicate that (1) ω series are decomposed into 4-, 12-, 20-, exceeding 20-year time scale oscillations and a residual component with an significantly increasing trend in the mainstream of the WRB, a non-significantly decreasing trend in the Jing River Basin and Beiluo River Basin; (2) by analyzing the residual trend component, evaporation ratio, soil moisture and effective irrigated area are found to induce the significant increase of ω in the upstream of the WRB, whereas that in the middle and lower reaches is dominated by baseflow and Ni{\~n}o 3.4; (3) ω dynamics at the 4-year time scale is dominated by evaporation ratio, aridity index, baseflow and soil moisture; baseflow, Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and sunspots attribute to the dynamics at 12-year time scale; all the factors except baseflow and soil moisture contribute to the dynamics at 20- or exceeding 20-year time scales. The results of this study will help identify the connection between watershed water-energy balance dynamics and changing environment at multiple time scales, and also be beneficial for guiding water resources management and ecological development planning on the Loess Plateau.}},

@article{Aizen_2007,
	abstract = {In this study, we estimated the current glacier state and forecast the potential impact of global
and regional climate change on the glaciers and glacier runoff in the Tien Shan. General (G)
and detailed (D) simulations were developed based on assessment of the Tien Shan glacier
recession between 1943 and 2003 using an iterative stepwise increase in the equilibrium line
altitude of 20 m. The G simulation was developed for 2777 grids each of which covered over
1000 km2 
of glacier surface and D for the 15 953 Tien Shan glaciers. Both simulations employed
glacier morphometric characteristics derived from Digital Elevation Model based on
remote sensing data, high resolution maps and in situ GPS validation. Simulated
changes in glacier area demonstrated that a possible increase in air temperature of
1 $\,^{\circ}$C 
at  must be compensated by a 100 mm increase in precipitation at the same altitude if Tien Shan
glaciers are to be maintained in their current state. An increase in mean air temperature of
4 $\,^{\circ}$C 
and precipitation of 1.1 times the current level could increase  by 570 m during the 21st century. Under these conditions, the number of glaciers,
glacier covered area, glacier volume, and glacier runoff are predicted to be 94%,
69%, 75%, and 75% of current values. The maximum glacier runoff may reach
as much as 1.25 times current levels while the minimum will likely equal zero.},

@article{gerlitz_2018,
	abstract = {{In order to understand the atmospheric mechanisms resulting in a pronounced cold season climate variability in Central Asia, an objective weather type classification is conducted, utilizing a k-means based clustering-approach applied to 500hPa geopotential height (GPH) fields. Eight weather types (WT) are identified and analyzed with regard to characteristic pressure patterns and moisture fluxes over Eurasia and specific near surface climate conditions over Central Asia. In order to identify remote drivers of the Central Asian climate, WT frequencies are analyzed for their relationships with tropical and extratropical teleconnection modes. The results indicate an influence of northern hemispheric planetary wave tracks on westerly moisture fluxes with positive anomalies of precipitation associated with the formation of a Rossby trough over Central Asia. Particularly the propagation of the East-Atlantic/Western-Russia and the Scandinavian patterns are shown to modulate regional climate conditions. Variations of ENSO are shown to affect the frequency of particular WTs due to the formation of an anticyclonic anomaly over the Indian Ocean and an increase of tropical fluxes of moisture and heat into Central Asia during El Nino events. Further a WT-internal influence of ENSO is distinctly defined, with enhanced moisture supply during the ENSO warm phase. The analysis of climatic trends shows that 50\% of observed temperature changes can be assigned to variations of the WT composition, indicating that most likely changing regional circulation characteristics account for the enhanced warming rates in Central Asia. Trends of precipitation sums are likewise shown to be associated with changing WT frequencies, although the WT-precipitation relationships include large uncertainties.}},

@article{siegfried_2012,
	abstract = {{Millions of people in the geopolitically important region of Central Asia depend on water from snow- and glacier-melt driven international rivers, most of all the Syr Darya and Amu Darya. The riparian countries of these rivers have experienced recurring water allocation conflicts ever since the Soviet Union collapsed. Will climate change exacerbate water stress and thus conflicts? We have developed a coupled climate, land-ice and rainfall-runoff model for the Syr Darya to quantify impacts and show that climatic changes are likely to have consequences on runoff seasonality due to earlier snow-melt. This will increase water stress in unregulated catchments because less water will be available for irrigation in the summer months. Threats from geohazards, above all glacier lake outbursts, are likely to increase as well. The area at highest risk is the densely populated, agriculturally productive, and politically unstable Fergana Valley. Targeted infrastructural developments will be required in the region. If the current mismanagement of water and energy resources can be replaced with more effective resource allocation mechanisms through the strengthening of transboundary institutions, Central Asia will be able to successfully address these future climate-related challenges.}},
