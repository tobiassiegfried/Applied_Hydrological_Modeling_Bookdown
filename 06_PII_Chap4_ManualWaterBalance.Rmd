# Budyko-Type Long-term Water Balance Modeling {#ManualWaterBalance}

In this Chapter, we are looking at watersheds from a long-term perspective and want to understand the key processes that lead to a partitioning of precipitation into evaporation and runoff.

## Derivation of the Budyko Relationship

The general water balance for a catchment can be written as

$$
Q = P - E + \Delta S 
(\#eq:WB1)
$$

where $P$ is precipitation in mm, $E$ is evapotranspiration in mm, $\Delta S$ is net storage and $Q$ is specific discharge in mm. Over hydrological years and longer time scales, we expect $\Delta S$ to be 0. Hence, the above Equation \@ref(eq:WB1) can be rewritten as

$$
Q = P - E 
(\#eq:WB2)
$$

Dividing by $P$, we get

$$
\frac{Q}{P} = 1 - \frac{E}{P} 
(\#eq:WB3)
$$

where $Q/P$ can be called the runoff index and $E/P$ is the evaporation index or evaporative fraction. Note that this equation does not take into account long-term storage effects from snow and land ice in a basin. We discuss more on this in the next Section below.

In the following derivation of the relationship between a catchment's aridity index and the evaporation fraction, we follow [@ARORA2002164].

The surface energy balance can be written as

$$
R_{N} = H_{S} + H_{L} + \Delta H_{G} 
(\#eq:EB1)
$$

where $R_{N}$ is the net radiation [in W/m^2^ = kg/s^3^], $H_{S}$ is the upward sensible heat flux, $H_{L}$ is the latent heat flux and $\Delta H_{G}$ the net ground heat flux. It should be noted that $H_{L} = L \cdot E$ where $L = 2.5 \cdot 10^{6}$ J/kg [= m^2^/s^2^] is the latent heat of vaporization and $E$ is the actual evaporation in [m/s]. As in the case of the water balance, at the annual or longer time scales, we can neglect the storage effect and get

$$
R_{N} = H_{S} + L \cdot E
(\#eq:ltEB)
$$

With the Bowen ratio defined as the fraction of the sensible heat flux divided by the latent heat flux, i.e.

$$
\gamma = \frac{H_{S}}{H_{L}} = \frac{H_{S}}{L \cdot E }
(\#eq:bowenRatio)
$$

and by rearranging the terms, the long-term energy balance in Equation \@ref(eq:ltEB) can simply be rewritten as

$$
R_{n} = (1 + \gamma)L E
(\#eq:EB2)
$$

Using the fact that $R_{n} = L E_{pot}$, where $E_{pot}$ is the potential evaporation, and dividing by precipitation, we can rewrite the above Equation \@ref(eq:EB2) as

$$
\frac{E_{pot}}{P} = (1 + \gamma) \frac{E}{P}
(\#eq:aridityIndex)
$$

where the left-hand side is called the aridity index, i.e. $\phi = E_{pot}/P$ and $E/P$ is called the evaporative fraction or evaporation index. With this, Equation \@ref(eq:WB3) from above can be written as a function of the Bowen ratio and the aridity index, i.e.

$$
\frac{E}{P} = 1 - \frac{Q}{P} = \frac{\phi}{(1 + \gamma)}
(\#eq:WBEB1)
$$

$Q/P$ is again the runoff index. Since the Bowen ratio is also water and energy limited, it too is a function of the aridity index and we can thus rewrite Equation \@ref(eq:WBEB1) to

$$
\frac{E}{P} = 1 - \frac{Q}{P} = F[\phi]
(\#eq:Budyko1)
$$

Following the groundbreaking work by Budyko and others, many expressions have been developed for $F[\phi]$ to describe the long-term catchment water balance (citations...). Here, we use the Choudhury equation which relates the aridity index $\phi$ to the evaporative fraction $E/P$ in the following way

$$
\frac{E}{P} = [ 1 + (\frac{E_{pot}}{P})^{-n}]^{-1/n}
(\#eq:Choudhury1)
$$

where $n$ is a catchment-specific parameter which accounts for factors such as vegetation type and coverage, soil type and topography, etc. (see e.g. [@Zhang2015] for more information).
