# Data Retrieval, Preparation & Analysis {#Chapter-RetrievalAnalysisHydroData}

In this Chapter, we will discuss how to retrieve, prepare and process the data that is required for modeling. This includes

-   in-situ station data,

-   geospatial data,

-   climate reanalysis data, and

-   climate projections data.

As will become clear, the preparation of these data requires a substantial amount of work, local storage space and, in some instances, computational power. With a focus on the generation of input files for hydrological-hydraulic modeling with RS Minerve, the flow diagram Figure \@ref(fig:ClimateImpactModelChain) shows the required steps for the individual data types. These steps will be discussed in the individual Sections below in detail.
