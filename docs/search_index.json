[["foreword.html", "Foreword", " Foreword Oasis between Samarkand and Buchara. Source: Tobias Siegfried, hydrosolutions GmbH. This is a online book about applied hydrological modeling. It is geared towards students and young professionals in Central Asia who are interested in learning modern modeling approaches. The book teaches by examples and uses two catchments from the Syr Darya and Amu Darya river basins as case studies. While the presented case studies are exclusively from Central Asia, the methods demonstrated can be applied elsewhere. The book is accompanied by a Study Exercise Pack that encompasses 7 Central Asian catchments which can be used by students for learning and applying their skill to real-world examples in the region. The Pack can accessed and downloaded here. Furthermore, a dedicated R Package has been developed which implements many of the data analyses and processing steps shown in this book. More information can be found on Github, where the package is maintained. R which is a programming language widely used in data analysis and mining (R Core Team 2013). The course is structured in the following way. First, key hydro-climatological characteristics of the region are presented. This Section draws heavily on Victor Shults’ “Rivers of Middle Asia” and presents relevant materials from this famous book in a modern way. Two important basins are further highlighted as in-depth case studies, i.e. the Gunt River in the Amu Darya catchment and the Chirchik river basin. The analyses of these catchments draws on available data from the Central Asian Hydrometeorological Services and on global public hydro-climatological as well as land cover datasets. A large Chapter on data covers in-situ station data, geospatial data, climate reanalysis and climate projection data. Workflows are presented for the Gunt river basin how to prepare all required data for transient hydrological model at hourly time scales. Three different types of hydrological modeling approaches are demonstrated and discussed in greater depth. First, long-term water balance modeling using the Budyko framework is introduced to discuss key determinants of the partitioning of precipitation into runoff and evaporation over climatological time scales. Second, a more detailed modeling approach using semi-distributed, conceptual hydrologic-hydraulic modeling will be used to demonstrate the implementation, calibration and validation of such type of models. Again, working by example, the free modeling software RS MINERVE is used for this purpose. Third and finally, empirical modeling will be introduced for forecasting. These types of models are currently utilized in the Hydrometeorological Agencies of the region for forecasting discharge at different lead times, ranging from one day ahead up to seasonal forecasts. These models use long term time series to learn relationships between past, observed quantities and future system responses. With everything that is presented, the focus is on the use of open source and free software. For data preparation and analysis as well as for water balance and empirical modeling, R and RStudio are utilized (R Core Team 2013; Team’ 2020). For the processing of geographic data, workflows in QGIS are demonstrated (QGIS Development Team 2021). For hydrological-hydraulic modeling, the free RS MINERVE is utilized which is a environment for the modeling of free surface runoff flow formation and propagation (Foehn et al. 2020; Garcia Hernandez et al. 2020). The reader is expected to have a basic understanding about R and QGIS and how to use these software for data analysis and processing. The R code to produce figures, conduct analyses as well carry out empirical modeling is deliberately provided throughout the text and embedded there. While this makes the text heavier than necessary, it gives the local target group to reuse code and directly reproduce results while working on their own problems. An attempt has been made to make everything as reproducible as possible. Feedback is welcome!

Below is a quick summary: QGIS R RStudio RS Minerve If you have not used the software above before we recommend the following resources to get your started (remember, more detailed instructions are available in the Appendix): QGIS training manual Modern Dive for getting started with R and RStudio RS Minerve User Manual Day 1: Introduction and installation of software This Module introduces the students to the key hydro-climatological characteristics of Central Asia. The main water resources management and planning challenges in the region will be presented and discussed. The question how hydrological models can help to address and resolve these becomes the key course topic. Two catchments, i.e. the Chirchik and Gunt river basins, will be highlighted and used as detailed motivational examples. All course examples will build on these two catchments later. Read Chapter 1: A short history of Water in Central Asia and Chapter 2: Hydrological Systems in Central Asia in the course book. Day 2: Catchment characterization Read the Case Studies in Chapter 3 and Station Data in Chapter 5 and do the exercise on catchment characterization, i.e. do a catchment characterization of your sample catchment in QGIS or in R.

Step-by-step instructions of how to do this are given in Chapter 5.2. As homework, read Chapter 6.2 and do the exercise on the linear reservoir model given below. Ex2 Exercise: The Linear Reservoir Part 1: Experimental setup To understand the flow of water through a reservoir, you will build a bucket model yourself at home from materials that you have at hand and measure recharge as well as discharge from the bucket. You will then make a numerical model of your real bucket model and simulate discharge. Think through the experiment and answer the following questions: What will determine the flow through your bucket? What do you need to measure? How can you measure it? What materials you will need to set up the experiment? Where will you get the water from and can you re-use it after the experiment? Solution to task 1 Part 2: Perform the experiment Set up the experiment and pour water into your improvised reservoir. Take care to pour with a continuous speed over a short time period. You may have to repeat the experiment a few times (see also notes on measurement accuracy in the solutions of part 1 of this exercise. The outcome of the experiment is a time series of discharge measurements. You can watch a video of the experiment here if you cannot perform the experiment yourself. Part 3: Simulate the experiment The figure below shows the measured discharge from the experimental data shown in the table above. We have implemented a discretized version of a linear reservoir model for you which shows the simulated discharge (grey bars) of a recharge event (blue bars). Play with the storage parameter by moving the slider and see how the simulated discharge changes based on the storage parameter of the simulated catchment. Can you reproduce the measured discharge? If you cannot find a perfect match between measurements and simulation results: What could be the reasons? (If you see an empty window below this text, go to the web app directly to do the exercise). Solution to task 3. App code available on GitHub. Day 4: Discussion of types of hydrological models Hydrological models in general are discussed. This topic currently doesn’t have a specific book chapter. Read Chapter 6.3 which is a short recap of the general modeling process. Ex3 Exercise: Work on your R skills Choose an R tutorial to work on from the Appendix which suits your skills. If you are already fluent in R, work on your visualization skills in R by producing nice plots of your sample catchment which you may include in the final presentation on the last day of the workshop. You may let yourselves be inspired by the R code supplied with this book. Day 5: The HBV model A commonly used hydrological model is introduced. Read Chapters 6.4 on the data preparation and 6.5 on the HBV model and the pre-requisite reading listed therein. It is recommended to do the tasks suggested in the course book to get more familiar with RS Minerve. Ex4 Exercise: Implement your catchment in RS Minerve Implement your catchment using HBV models based on the catchment characterization that you performed on day 2 and the GIS layers that you prepared on day 3. Day 6: Model calibration and validation Read Chapter 6.6 and go through the example of the Nauvalisoy catchment which illustrates the iterative model refinement process. Ex5 Exercise: Calibrate and validate your RS Minerve model Calibrate and validate your RS Minerve model. Day 7: Case studies Discussion of the calibration and validation exercise followed by a presentation of the Gunt basin case study. As homework students will Ex6 Exercise: Submit an abstract for the final conference Write an abstract about your modeling work for the final conference. Instructions for abstract writing are available here. The abstract submission deadline is Friday, May 14, 18:00 Almaty time. Day 8: Real-world applications Presentation of examples of real-world applications of hydrological models. As homework students will finalize the presentation about their modeling work. Ex7 Exercise: Finalize presentation Finalize the presentation of your modelling work during this workshop for the final conference. Each student group will be alloted 15 minutes for their presentation. Tips for oral presentations (AGU guidelines for oral presentations) Be considerate of other speakers and the audience by staying within your allotted time for your brief summary. Session chairs will hold you to the allotted time, which is essential to ensure adequate time for questions and discussion with the online audience. Take time to rehearse your brief presentation. If your presentation runs longer than your allotted time, eliminate the least essential material and rehearse again. Prepare your overview in advance so that your ideas are logically organized and your points are clear. Give an opening statement to acquaint the audience with the nature and purpose of the study. Speak slowly and clearly. Word choice should be simple: use active words and short sentences. Some viewers may be using online translation services. Day 9: Student presentations and wrap-up of workshop The last day of the workshop is organized as a student conference where students present their modeling work on their respective case study catchment. The groups need to prepare a presentation of 12 minutes duration. Each presentation will be followed by a 3 minutes Q&amp;A session. After all the groups have presented, impressions and feedback will be shared by the teachers followed by a larger group discussion. "],["study-materials.html", "Study Materials", " Study Materials The available course study materials are presented here. Groups of two students working jointly on one of the provided basins throughout the course is effective. The data are available for download under this link. Please note that the size of the complete case study pack is approx 2 GB. So it might be better to just download the relevant files / folder for the corresponding basin you are working on. The geospatial data layers can be viewed, processed and analyzed in QGIS and/or R, depending on your preference. The discharge data is stored in R .rds format and needs to be opened and analyzed in R/RStudio. The directory tree of an example catchment (Gunt river basin) is shown below. All directory files contain correspondingly similar files1 (see Figure 0.1 for an example). The ./Basin/ subfolder contains the basin shapefile delineating the catchment. The ./Climatology/ is empty to start with and students are asked to extract the relevant data for their catchment. These data include long-term mean temperature 2 meters above surface, total precipitation as well as reference potential evapotranspiration and the aridity index. The regional raster climate data are provided under ./STUDENTS_CaseStudyPacks/CLIMATE on Dropbox. Data are discussed below below. A QGIS project has been setup for viewing and analyzing these data. It is available under ./STUDENTS_CaseStudyPacks/STUDENTS_CaseStudyProject.qgz. Figure 0.1: Sample directory structure of the Gunt river basin. An overview over the available basins in the study pack is shown in Figure 0.2. All data can be accessed in the corresponding QGIS project. Figure 0.2: Overview map of the Central Asia region with the 7 study basins. The rivers include the Gunt River in the Amu Darya basin, the Sokh and Isfayramsoy rivers in the Syr Darya basin, the Pskem and Chatkal rivers in the Chirchik river basin and finally, the Ala Archa and Chon Kemin rivers in the Chu river basins. The catchments are delineated with by the black polygons and the location of the individual gauges highlighted with the red circles. The next Figures shows the distribution of land ice in the Central Asia Region (see Figure 0.3). Land ice data is from (GLIMS and NSIDC 2005) and has been prepared for the Central Asia domain. These data have also been prepared for the individual catchments and are stored in the corresponding ./Glaciers/ folder. Figure 0.3: Distribution of land ice in the Central Asia region. Source Data: GLIMS SRTM data for all catchments have been downloaded (“Srtmgl1 n -ASA SRTM Version 3.0” 2020). Rectangular areas surrounding each catchment are available and provide the basis for further analysis. These data are raw data and not hydrologically corrected. The data are required for basin characterization, i.e. minimum, maximum and mean elevation, the derivation of the hypsometric curve and the preparation of the RS MINERVE modeling input files. Figure 0.4: SRTM digital elevation models for catchments. Source Data: SRTM (“Srtmgl1 n -ASA SRTM Version 3.0” 2020) CHELSA (Climatologies at high resolution for the earth’s land surface areas) data of downscaled model output temperature and bias-corrected precipitation estimates of the ERA-Interim climatic reanalysis to a high resolution of 30 arc sec are provided in the ./STUDENTS_CaseStudyPacks/CLIMATE folder. The data set covers the year 1981 - 2013 and are described in (Karger et al. 2017) and (Beck et al. 2019). More information is also provided in the Chapter 3. Figure 0.5 shows the long-term mean 2 meters above surface temperature over the Central Asia domain and Figure 0.6 the precipitation raster. Figure 0.5: Long-term mean 2 meter above surface temperature. Source Data: (Karger et al. 2017). Pink colors are indicate warm regions, dark blue to purple colors indicate cold regions. The long-term precipitation norm over the period 1981 - 2013 is shown in Figure 0.6. Figure 0.6: Long-term mean precipitation. Source Data: CHESLA data (Karger et al. 2017) bias corrected for snow undercatch as described by (Beck et al. 2019). Dark blue values in high mountain terrain indicate norm precipitation P &gt; 2’000 mm/a whereas bright blue to white colors indicate arid to hyperarid climate conditions with P &lt; 300 mm/a. Figure 0.7 shows the norm potential evapotranspiration over the Central Asia domain. Source data are from Global Aridity Index and Potential Evapotranspiration Climate Database v2 available under this link (Trabucco and Zomer 2019). Aridity index data is shown in Figure ??. The data are high-resolution (30 arc-seconds) raster climate data for the 1970-2000 period, related to evapotranspiration processes and rainfall deficit for potential vegetative growth, based on the implementation of a Penman-Montieth Reference Evapotranspiration (ET0) equation. Figure 0.7: Norm potential reference evapotranspiration (ETpot) Dark blue colors are &gt; 2’000 mm/a whereas bright blue to white colors indicate values &lt; 500 mm/a. Source Data: (Trabucco and Zomer 2019) Figure 0.8: Aridity Index over Central Asia. Red colors are high aridity index values where as blue colors indicate low index values. Source Data: (Trabucco and Zomer 2019) Finally, land cover data from 2019 are provided (Buchhorn et al., n.d.). These are shown in Figure ??. The pseudocolors denote the following classification: Red color: Built-up land Pink color: Crop land Yellow color: Herbaceous vegetation Orange Color: Shrubland Blue Color: Permanent water bodies Green color: Forest Grey color: Bare / Sparse Vegetation White color: Snow and ice knitr::include_graphics(&#39;../HydrologicalModeling_CentralAsia/_bookdown_files/FIG_FOREWORD/landcover_CA&#39;) All these data are required data for the course. For the hydrological modeling, further temporal climate data are required (hourly data fields). These and how they can be accessed is described in greater detail in the Chapter ?? and the corresponding Sections there. You can generate such type of directory tree output in a convenient manner using the fs::dir_tree(path='...',recurse = TRUE) function that is provided with the fs package.↩︎ "]]
