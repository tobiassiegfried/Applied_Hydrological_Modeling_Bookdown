It is geared towards students and young professionals in Central Asia who are interested in learning modern modeling approaches. The book teaches by examples and uses two catchments from the Syr Darya and Amu Darya river basins as case studies. While the presented case studies are exclusively from Central Asia, the methods demonstrated can be applied elsewhere. First, key hydro-climatological characteristics of the region are presented. This Section draws heavily on Victor Shults’ “Rivers of Middle Asia” and presents relevant materials from this famous book in a modern way. Two hydrological basins are further highlighted in in-depth case studies, i.e. the Gunt River in the Amu Darya catchment and the Chirchik river basin as the biggest right tributary to Syr Darya. The analyses of these catchments draws on available data from the Central Asian Hydrometeorological Services. The analysis of the available hydro-meteorological data uses different types of methods implemented in R which is a programming language widely used in data analysis and mining (R Core Team 2013). Three different types of modeling approaches are demonstrated and discussed in greater depth. First, long-term water balance modeling using the Budyko framework is introduced to discuss and demonstrate the quantification of climate change impacts on hydrological systems in Central Asia. Using this type of model, the effects of climate change on the long-term water balance are discussed for the Gunt River. The Gunt river is one of the key right tributaries to the Pjandz, i.e. the upstream Amu Darya, and emerges at high altitudes in the eastern Pamirs. Second, a more detailed modeling approach using semi-distributed, lumped, conceptual hydrologic-hydraulic modeling will be used to demonstrate how intra-annual changes due to climate forcing and changes therein can be quantified. These approaches will be demonstrated again for the Gunt catchment and also for the Chirchik river basin and its tributaries. Furthermore, the use of these models to study different kinds of reservoir operations will be presented and impact on hydropower production as well as on downstream water availability discussed. Third and finally, empirical modeling will be introduced for forecasting. These types of models are currently utilized in the Hydrometeorological Agencies of the region for forecasting discharge at different lead times, ranging from one day ahead up to seasonal forecasts. These models use long term time series to learn relationships between past, observed quantities and future system responses. With everything that is presented, the focus is on the use of open source and free software. For data preparation and analysis as well as for water balance and empirical modeling, R and RStudio are utilized (R Core Team 2013; Team’ 2020). For the processing of geographic data, workflows in QGIS are demonstrated (QGIS Development Team 2021). For hydrological-hydraulic modeling, the free RS MINERVE is utilized which is a environment for the modeling of free surface runoff flow formation and propagation (Foehn et al. 2020; Garcia Hernandez et al. 2020). The reader is expected to have a basic understanding about R and QGIS and how to use these software for data analysis and processing. The R code to produce figures, conduct analyses as well carry out empirical modeling is deliberately provided throughout the text and embedded there. While this makes the text heavier than necessary, it gives the local target group to reuse code and directly reproduce results while working on their own problems. An attempt has been made to make everything as reproducible as possible. "],["study-guide.html", "Study Guide &amp; Materials", " Study Guide &amp; Materials This course book has been designed to accompany a 2-week master-level course for aspiring water professionals at the Kazakh-German University in Almaty. At least part of the material can be covered in 10 work days. The workshop participants will be guided through implementing their own hydrological model of a sample catchment of their choice in Central Asia. The readers are recommended to work through the texts in each chapter including the tasks that serve to deepen reflection on the course material and to do their daily homework on the modeling of the sample catchment. The homework will be presented in a final conference and is part of the performance review of the course. This chapter explains how to use this course book. Exercises are highlighted with blue boxes: Ex1 This is an exercise box With the description of the exercise, hints and a link to the solutions. Exercises should be completed before starting the next course chapter. Tasks that enforce deeper learning of the course material are highlighted in green: T1 This is a task box Tasks do not always have a solution. They encourage you to reflect on the course material and to deepen your knowledge. Take home messages or important notes are highlighted in red: N1 This is a note box Note boxes summarize the most important take home messages.

Then make sure the requried software for this course is installed on your computer. Section Open-source resources of the Appendix includes installation instructions and the on-line learning material that can get you started with the software. Below is a quick summary: QGIS R RStudio RS Minerve If you have not used the software above before we recommend the following resources to get your started (remember, more detailed instructions are available in the Appendix): QGIS training manual Modern Dive for getting started with R and RStudio RS Minerve User Manual Day 2: Catchment characterization Read the Case Studies in Chapter 3 and Station Data in Chapter 5 and do the exercise on catchment characterization, i.e. do a catchment characterization of your sample catchment. Todo: Link to exercise Day 3: Geospatial data and introduction to linear reservoir models Read Chapter 5.2 on Geospatial Data and prepare the GIS layers for import into RS Minerve for your sample catchment. Step-by-step instructions of how to do this are given in Chapter 5.2. As homework, read Chapter 6.2 and do the exercise on the linear reservoir model. Day 4: Discussion of types of hydrological models Hydrological models in general are discussed. This topic currently doesn’t have a specific book chapter. Read Chapter 6.3 which is a short recap of the general modeling process. As homework, choose an R tutorial to work on from the Appendix which suits your skills. If you are already fluent in R, work on your visualization skills in R by producing nice plots of your sample catchment which you may include in the final presentation on the last day of the workshop. You may let yourselves be inspired by the R code supplied with this book. Day 5: The HBV model A commonly used hydrological model is introduced. Read Chapters 6.4 on the data preparation and 6.5 on the HBV model and the pre-requisite reading listed therein. It is recommended to do the tasks suggested in the course book to get more familiar with RS Minerve. As an exercise, you will implement your catchment using HBV models based on the catchment characterization that you performed on day 2 and the GIS layers that you prepared on day 3. Day 6: Model calibration and validation Read Chapter 6.6 and go through the example of the Nauvalisoy catchment which illustrates the iterative model refinement process. As homework students will calibrate and validate the hydrological models of their own sample catchment. Day 7: Case studies Discussion of the calibration and validation exercise followed by a presentation of the Gunt basin case study. As homework students will write an abstract about your modeling work for the final conference. Instructions for abstract writing are available here. The abstract submission deadline is Friday, May 14, 18:00 Almaty time. Day 8: Real-world applications Presentation of examples of real-world applications of hydrological models. As homework students will finalize the presentation about their modeling work. Day 9: Student presentations and wrap-up of workshop The last day of the workshop is organized as a conference where students present their modeling work on the sample catchments. "],["study-materials.html", "Study Materials", " Study Materials The available course study materials are presented here. The idea is to have groups of two students working jointly on one basin. The data available are described here and are available for download under this link. Please note that the complete case study pack folder is approx 2 GB. So it might be better to just download the relevant files / folder for the corresponding basin you are working on. The geospatial data layers can be viewed, processed and analyzed in QGIS or R, depending on your preference. The discharge data is stored in R .rds format and needs to be opened in R/RStudio. The directory tree of the example Gunt catchment is shown below. All directory files contain correspondingly similar files. knitr::include_graphics(&#39;./_bookdown_files/FIG_FOREWORD/sampleStudentPackDirectoryTree&#39;) Figure 0.1: Sample directory structure of the Gunt river basin.
