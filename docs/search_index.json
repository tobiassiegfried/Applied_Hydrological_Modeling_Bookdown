"],["derivation-of-the-budyko-relationship.html", "3.1 Derivation of the Budyko Relationship", " 3.1 Derivation of the Budyko Relationship The general water balance for a catchment can be written as \\[ Q = P - E + \\Delta S \\tag{3.1} \\] where \\(P\\) is precipitation in mm, \\(E\\) is evapotranspiration in mm, \\(\\Delta S\\) is net storage and \\(Q\\) is specific discharge in mm. Over hydrological years and longer time scales, we expect \\(\\Delta S\\) to be 0. Hence, the above Equation (3.1) can be rewritten as \\[ Q = P - E \\tag{3.2} \\] Dividing by \\(P\\), we get \\[ \\frac{Q}{P} = 1 - \\frac{E}{P} \\tag{3.3} \\] where \\(Q/P\\) can be called the runoff index and \\(E/P\\) is the evaporation index or evaporative fraction. Note that this equation does not take into account long-term storage effects from snow and land ice in a basin. We discuss more on this in the next Section below. In the following derivation of the relationship between a catchment’s aridity index and the evaporation fraction, we follow (Arora 2002). The surface energy balance can be written as \\[ R_{N} = H_{S} + H_{L} + \\Delta H_{G} \\tag{3.4} \\] where \\(R_{N}\\) is the net radiation [in W/m2 = kg/s3], \\(H_{S}\\) is the upward sensible heat flux, \\(H_{L}\\) is the latent heat flux and \\(\\Delta H_{G}\\) the net ground heat flux. It should be noted that \\(H_{L} = L \\cdot E\\) where \\(L = 2.5 \\cdot 10^{6}\\) J/kg [= m2/s2] is the latent heat of vaporization and \\(E\\) is the actual evaporation in [m/s]. As in the case of the water balance, at the annual or longer time scales, we can neglect the storage effect and get \\[ R_{N} = H_{S} + L \\cdot E \\tag{3.5} \\] With the Bowen ratio defined as the fraction of the sensible heat flux divided by the latent heat flux, i.e. \\[ \\gamma = \\frac{H_{S}}{H_{L}} = \\frac{H_{S}}{L \\cdot E } \\tag{3.6} \\] and by rearranging the terms, the long-term energy balance in Equation (3.5) can simply be rewritten as \\[ R_{n} = (1 + \\gamma)L E \\tag{3.7} \\] Using the fact that \\(R_{n} = L E_{pot}\\), where \\(E_{pot}\\) is the potential evaporation, and dividing by precipitation, we can rewrite the above Equation (3.7) as \\[ \\frac{E_{pot}}{P} = (1 + \\gamma) \\frac{E}{P} \\tag{3.8} \\] where the left-hand side is called the aridity index, i.e. \\(\\phi = E_{pot}/P\\) and \\(E/P\\) is called the evaporative fraction or evaporation index. With this, Equation (3.3) from above can be written as a function of the Bowen ratio and the aridity index, i.e. \\[ \\frac{E}{P} = 1 - \\frac{Q}{P} = \\frac{\\phi}{(1 + \\gamma)} \\tag{3.9} \\] \\(Q/P\\) is again the runoff index. Since the Bowen ratio is also water and energy limited, it too is a function of the aridity index and we can thus rewrite Equation (3.9) to \\[ \\frac{E}{P} = 1 - \\frac{Q}{P} = F[\\phi] \\tag{3.10} \\] Following the groundbreaking work by Budyko and others, many expressions have been developed for \\(F[\\phi]\\) to describe the long-term catchment water balance (citations…). Here, we use the Choudhury equation which relates the aridity index \\(\\phi\\) to the evaporative fraction \\(E/P\\) in the following way \\[ \\frac{E}{P} = [ 1 + (\\frac{E_{pot}}{P})^{-n}]^{-1/n} \\tag{3.11} \\] where \\(n\\) is a catchment-specific parameter which accounts for factors such as vegetation type and coverage, soil type and topography, etc. (see e.g. (Zhang et al. 2015) for more information).
