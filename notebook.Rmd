- TAKIR surface flow: Surface flow in the plains is most intense on so-called takirs. A takir is usually formed in a shallow depressed area with a heavy clay soil, which is submerged by water after seasonal rains. After the water evaporates, a dried crust with fissures forms on the surface. Runoff from the takirs and takir-like areas has ever since been used by the locals to cover their freshwater needs.


The highly continental location, while being unprotected from the north by mountain ranges, causes an extremely dry continental climate with dry cloudless hot summers, followed by relatively humid winters, sometimes also with severe frost, particularly, in the north which is regularly influenced by Siberian high pressure.
