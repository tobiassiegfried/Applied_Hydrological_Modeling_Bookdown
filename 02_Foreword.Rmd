This is a online book about applied hydrological modeling. It is geared towards students and young professionals in Central Asia who are interested in learning modern modeling approaches. The book teaches by examples and uses two catchments from the Syr Darya and Amu Darya river basins as case studies. While the presented case studies are exclusively from Central Asia, the methods demonstrated can be applied elsewhere.

First, key hydro-climatological characteristics of the region are presented. This Section draws heavily on Victor Shults' "Rivers of Middle Asia" and presents relevant materials from this famous book in a modern way. Two hydrological basins are further highlighted in in-depth case studies, i.e. the Gunt River in the Amu Darya catchment and the Chirchik river basin as the biggest right tributary to Syr Darya. The analyses of these catchments draws on available data from the Central Asian Hydrometeorological Services. The analysis of the available hydro-meteorological data uses different types of methods implemented in R which is a programming language widely used in data analysis and mining [@R-2013].

Three different types of modeling approaches are demonstrated and discussed in greater depth. First, long-term water balance modeling using the Budyko framework is introduced to discuss and demonstrate the quantification of climate change impacts on hydrological systems in Central Asia. Using this type of model, the effects of climate change on the long-term water balance are discussed for the Gunt River. The Gunt river is one of the key right tributaries to the Pjandz, i.e. the upstream Amu Darya, and emerges at high altitudes in the eastern Pamirs.

Second, a more detailed modeling approach using semi-distributed, lumped, conceptual hydrologic-hydraulic modeling will be used to demonstrate how intra-annual changes due to climate forcing and changes therein can be quantified. These approaches will be demonstrated again for the Gunt catchment and also for the Chirchik river basin and its tributaries. Furthermore, the use of these models to study different kinds of reservoir operations will be presented and impact on hydropower production as well as on downstream water availability discussed.

Third and finally, empirical modeling will be introduced for forecasting. These types of models are currently utilized in the Hydrometeorological Agencies of the region for forecasting discharge at different lead times, ranging from one day ahead up to seasonal forecasts. These models use long term time series to learn relationships between past, observed quantities and future system responses.

With everything that is presented, the focus is on the use of open source and free software. For data preparation and analysis as well as for water balance and empirical modeling, [R](https://www.r-project.org) and [RStudio](https://rstudio.com) are utilized [@R-2013; @RStudio-2020]. For the processing of geographic data, workflows in [QGIS](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/) are demonstrated [@QGIS_software]. For hydrological-hydraulic modeling, the free [RS MINERVE](https://www.crealp.ch/fr/accueil/outils-services/logiciels/rs-minerve.html) is utilized which is a environment for the modeling of free surface runoff flow formation and propagation [@rsminerve_um; @rsminerve_tm]. The reader is expected to have a basic understanding about R and QGIS and how to use these software for data analysis and processing.

The R code to produce figures, conduct analyses as well carry out empirical modeling is deliberately provided throughout the text and embedded there. While this makes the text heavier than necessary, it gives the local target group to reuse code and directly reproduce results while working on their own problems. An attempt has been made to make everything as reproducible as possible.

# Study Guide & Materials {#study-guide .unnumbered}

This course book has been designed to accompany a 2-week master-level course for aspiring water professionals at the Kazakh-German University in Almaty. At least part of the material can be covered in 10 work days. The workshop participants will be guided through implementing their own hydrological model of a sample catchment of their choice in Central Asia. The readers are recommended to work through the texts in each chapter including the tasks that serve to deepen reflection on the course material and to do their daily homework on the modeling of the sample catchment. The homework will be presented in a final conference and is part of the performance review of the course. This chapter explains how to use this course book.

Exercises are highlighted with blue boxes:

```{r, eval = "html", label="intro-exercise-box", results='asis', echo=FALSE, purl=FALSE}

## Study Materials {.unnumbered}

The available course study materials are presented here. Groups of two students working jointly on one of the provided basins throughout the course is effective. The data are available for download under this [link](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/tucg4eno67ndpp0/AADpkSbovUpBx5vhzUJuDquwa?dl=0). Please note that the size of the complete case study pack is approx 2 GB. So it might be better to just download the relevant files / folder for the corresponding basin you are working on. The geospatial data layers can be viewed, processed and analyzed in QGIS and/or R, depending on your preference. The discharge data is stored in R `.rds` format and needs to be opened and analyzed in R/RStudio.

The directory tree of an example catchment (Gunt river basin) is shown below. All directory files contain correspondingly similar files[^foreword-1]. The `./Basin/` subfolder contains the basin shapefile delineating the catchment. The `./Climatology/` is empty to start with and students are asked to extract the relevant data on long-term mean temperature 2 meters above surface and total precipitation as well as reference potential evapotranspiration and the aridity index from regional climate fields that are provided under `./STUDENTS_CaseStudyPacks/CLIMATE`. These files are visualized in the Figures below.

[^foreword-1]: You can generate such type of directory tree output in a convenient manner using the `fs::dir_tree(path='...',recurse = TRUE)` function that is provided with the fs package.

```{r sampleDirectoryStructure, echo=FALSE, out.width= "50%", fig.cap="Sample directory structure of the Gunt river basin."}
